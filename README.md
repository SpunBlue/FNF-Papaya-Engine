# FNF-Papaya-Engine
A Friday Night Funkin' Engine made for hardcoded modifications. Created for the KAVIFUNK Mod to use as a base.

## What is this engine for?
This engine was made as a quick-start for Hardmodded modifications to Friday Night Funkin'. This way, you don't have to use the base game or another FNF Engine and be forced
to either fix up the base game, or remove bloat from the other Engines.

### How do I use the engine?
This Engine does not, and will likely never, support softmodding. If I do, it will be because I feel like it. Now, here's how to use it.

- Fork the Repository
- Use GitHub Desktop or Git to clone the Repo to your device
- Install Haxe, Lime, OpenFL, and Flixel.
- Install the libraries located in the `Project.xml`.
- Open the Repo in VS:Code and begin modding!

### Can I contribute to the Engine?
Hell yeah you can.

## Q & A
### Can I use this as a base for my own FNF Engine?
I legally cannot stop you, but I'd prefer not. If there is a demand for soft modding support for Papaya Engine for whatever reason, I will fork the repo and do it myself.
### Can I use this for my mod?
Yes. Not like I'd be able to stop you if I said no.
### What do you plan on implementing?
I plan on implementing easy tools for developing your FNF Mod into the Engine, and make it easier and simpler to get started.
### What happened to Sublime Engine, Blueberry Engine, and Blackberry Engine? And why are they all named after fruits?
We don't talk about those... but seriously, they were programmed badly and lazily, and were made for softmodding. This is not.
