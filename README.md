# FNF-Papaya-Engine
A Friday Night Funkin' Engine made for hardcoded modifications. Created for the KAVIFUNK Mod to use as a base.

## How do I use the engine?
This Engine does not, and will likely never, support softmodding. If I do, it will be because I feel like it. Now, here's how to use it.

- Fork the Repository
- Use GitHub Desktop or Git to clone the Repo to your device
- Install Haxe, Lime, OpenFL, and Flixel.
- Install the libraries located in the `Project.xml`.
- Open the Repo in VS:Code and begin modding!

## Can I contribute to the Engine?
Hell yeah you can.
