# FNF-Papaya-Engine
A Friday Night Funkin' Engine made for hardcoded modifications. Created for the KAVIFUNK Mod to use as a base.

## What is this engine for?
This engine was made as a quick-start for Hard-modded modifications to Friday Night Funkin'. This way, you don't have to use the base game or another FNF Engine and be forced
to either fix up the base game, or remove bloat from the other Engines.

### How do I use the engine?
This Engine is NOT made for Soft-modding. It is purely for Hard-coded modifications to the source code. Now, here's how to use it.

- Fork the Repository
- Use GitHub Desktop or Git to clone the Repo to your device
- Follow this [Guide](build.md).
- Open the Repo in VS:Code and begin modding!

### Can I contribute to the Engine?
Hell yeah you can, just make sure all contributions are made to the Dev branch.

## Q & A
### Can I use this as a base for my own FNF Engine?
I can't stop you, but I'd prefer not. I do plan on making a version of this Engine called "Fruitbowl Engine" that implements Soft-modding into Papaya Engine.
### Can I use this for my mod?
Yes. Not like I'd be able to stop you if I said no, and why would I say no?
### Do you have any tools to help me get started?
Sort of! [Papaya Tools](https://github.com/SpunBlue/Papaya-Tools) lets you convert Psych Engine charts to Papaya Engine, and even the other way around!
### What happened to Sublime Engine, Blueberry Engine, and Blackberry Engine? And why are they all named after fruits?
We don't talk about those... but seriously, they were programmed badly and lazily, and were made for softmodding. This is not.
### Why isn't this a fork of the official FNF Repo?
Because it doesn't let me fork a repo I already have a fork of, and I'm not moving it to an organization like I did with Sublime Engine.
